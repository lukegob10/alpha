const CODEBASE_SEARCH_DESCRIPTION = `Find files most relevant to the search query using semantic search. Searches based on meaning rather than exact text matches. By default searches entire workspace. Reuse the user's exact wording unless there's a clear reason not to - their phrasing often helps semantic search. Queries MUST be in English (translate if needed).

Use semantic search when the implementation's location is unknown and a concept-based query will help locate it. When a relevant path or line is already known, read it directly; use search_files for exact names or text. Reuse relevant evidence already obtained. Search another area only to resolve a material unanswered question, dependency, or contradiction in the requested task.

Parameters:
- query: (required) The search query. Reuse the user's exact wording/question format unless there's a clear reason not to.
- path: (optional) Limit search to specific subdirectory (relative to the current workspace directory). Leave empty for entire workspace.

Example: Searching for user authentication code
{ "query": "User login and password hashing", "path": "src/auth" }

Example: Searching entire workspace
{ "query": "database connection pooling", "path": null }`

const QUERY_PARAMETER_DESCRIPTION = `Meaning-based search query describing the information you need`
